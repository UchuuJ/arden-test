# Code Test

The code included here is a basic example of a shop front.  
We would like you to use this code and work through the requested (and intentionally vague) enhancements below.

**Please do not spend an excessive amount of time on this, I would say 4 hours maximum.**.

Some of the tasks (e.g. switching to a database) would be a stretch for a mid-level role.  
We really just want to see that you can write PHP and talk about your decisions.

## Requested enhancements

1. There are some errors in the code. Please fix them.  
   There are also some warnings. Please fix the warnings in the code.
2. Update the project to add the classes to represent the top 5 most popular products for this store.  
   Please follow existing patterns for how models and views might work.  
   Please include images for these products from free sources.
3. Add a database backend for all models in the project. 
4. Update HTML of the "Opening times" to render as a table.
5. Add a contact form with validation. The form must send the responses via email.  
   The form must have the following fields: Name, email address, message.  
6. Save the contact form submissions to the database.


# Extra guidance

## git

- Please make these updates within a git repository (we'd expect a number of commits).
- You can share as a repository (e.g. from a github account), or just create an archive of the directory (including the .git directory) on your computer and share that.

## PHP

- We use PHP 8.3, but you can use 8.2 or 8.1 if preferred.
- Please conform to code style standards already used.
- Add comments where appropriate for code that's added.
